# This, plus running latest Combofix is all the security you need on Windows.
# Combofix is basically a virus that hunts and destroys other viruses.
# Don't worry about combofix unsupported OS message. It's running.
# Regarding combofix and other downloads, I recommend you use PatchMyPC Home Updater app.
